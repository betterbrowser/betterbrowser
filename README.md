## What is betterbrowser?
A compilation of browser modifications and browsers that makes the internet experience better.

With the core of reinventing the internet, betterbrowser is the team that works to make the internet experience better by making it a more safe, fun and private place made for **you**

> BetterBrowser is a small open-source team so please don't rush our projects, we do the best we can.

## Why?
We believe browser have lost some of the things that made then so incredible, browsers should be customizable, adjustable, comfortable to use and private. Browsers are the viewport of the internet and i believe it should be a place as good as **you** want.

## Who we are?
You can see our "official" members [here](https://github.com/orgs/betterbrowser/people) but we are betterbrowser. BetterBrowser is a community (and not the one on discord linked on our site). BetterBrowser is a community of people that believe we can improve the internet experience. A community that wants the internet to be like it was in the past or simulate what it gonna be in the future. A community that wants a better viewport to the internet, a BetterBrowser.
